SubRosa is basic tool written in python that helps automate some of tasks during the PE files backdooring process. The following are list of the current and future features:
- [x] Check/Disable ASLR
- [x] Search for exsisting code caves
- [x] Add new section
- [x] Split file to smaller chuncks for further analysis
- [ ] Add AV sandbox evasion template (heuristic analysis)
- [ ] Add custom encoder template to bypass AV (signature-based) detection
